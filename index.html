                    We're alive! I'm here to bring you up to speed a little bit on the project and give some important information.
                </p>
                <hr/>
                <ul>
                    <li>Progress is being made towards creating the base architecture made for the app, we don't have a timeframe yet but we do want to get things moving as fast as possible.</li>
                    <li>What we are trying to create is essentially a clone of Reddit to create a place for moderators and users to move their communities if they wish due to the current situation.</li>
                    <li>We do also want to offer, even before there's a full website, a way for you all to transfer your account data (posts, comments, karma, username) across to us. More thought is being put into the logistics of this but for now, no matter how much you want to protest against Reddit, keeping your account up is a good idea if this is something you'd be interested in.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr/>
                <p>Finally, I just want to put a little disclaimer here and say there is absolutely no guarantee that we will be able to finish creating this product, we're all volunteering and it's a big undertaking. Once our DevOps are a bit stronger we'll most likely be happy to take on more people interested in development, and there has been talk of creating a way of supporting the team financially if that is of any interest to you guys.</p>
                <p>If you made it this far I appreciate you putting in the time to check this page, and I hope you're as invested in this as we are :></p>
